# 🗄️ SQL Projects

This repository highlights my hands-on projects using **SQL for data analysis, querying, and business insights**.  
It includes work with **Kaggle BigQuery datasets**, where I explored topics like crime data, air quality, and real-world analytics.

Each project demonstrates:
- Writing optimized **SQL queries**  
- Using **aggregation, filtering, and joins**  
- Generating insights from **large-scale datasets**  
- Integration of SQL results into **Python (Pandas/Matplotlib)** for further analysis

## 📂 Projects
1. **Chicago Crime Dataset Analysis** → Querying tables to extract crime trends, date ranges, and geographic insights.  
2. **OpenAQ Air Quality Analysis** → Identifying pollution levels, city comparisons, and unit measurements.  
3. **Hacker News Jobs Analysis** → Exploring job post scores and trends using safe query execution limits.

## 🚀 Skills Highlighted
- BigQuery integration (Kaggle)  
- Query optimization and safe execution (dry run, billing limits)  
- Data wrangling with SQL & Python combined  
- Turning raw query results into **business insights**
