# 🗄️ SQL Projects

This repository highlights my hands-on projects using **SQL for data analysis, querying, and business insights**.  
It includes work with **Kaggle BigQuery datasets**, where I explored topics like crime data, air quality, and real-world analytics.

Each project demonstrates:
- Writing optimized **SQL queries**  
- Using **aggregation, filtering, and joins**  
- Generating insights from **large-scale datasets**  
- Integration of SQL results into **Python (Pandas/Matplotlib)** for further analysis
